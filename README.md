# favorite-cmd-commands
My favorite 3 cmd commands are 'brew doctor', 'git status' and 'code .'.

# 'brew doctor'
Brew Doctor is Homebrew's own self-diagnosis tool. The best part of 'brew doctor' is it says how to fix if something is wrong.

# 'git status'
It provides info of file's git status.

# 'code .'
It opens VSCode. The '.' represent the directory you are in.
